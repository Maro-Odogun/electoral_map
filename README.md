This is a dashboard showing the electoral landscape in Nigeria. It shows maps for the presidential election results for 2015 through 2023, 
pie charts showing the distribution of senate and house seats amongst political parties from 2007 through 2023, 
and voter participation trends from 2011 through 2023. This was built using Plotly and Dash.

This was largely inspired by a similar project carried out by the intelligence company Stears. The challenge was to find a way to recreate their work using python tools.
